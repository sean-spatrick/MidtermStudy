# MidtermStudy

This is an example of code I wrote to study for a Data Structures Midterm 

Within it you will find implementations of 
-Recursive algorithms 
-Dynamic Programming with Top Down and Bottom Up implementations 
-A Binary Tree Class (linked list implementation) with recursive methods for Preorder Postorder & Inorder traversals
-A Stack Class (Linked List Implementation)
